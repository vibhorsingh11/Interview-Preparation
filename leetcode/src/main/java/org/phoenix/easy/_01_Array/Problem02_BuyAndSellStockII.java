/*
 * Say you have an array prices for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
 * Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and
 * sell one share of the stock multiple times).
 * Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
 * Output: 7
